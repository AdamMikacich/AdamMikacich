            <h2>What is Lift?</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Lift, a perpendicular force to the direction of flow, enables airplanes to achieve flight through an aerodynamic design. In addition to experiencing a lift force, aircraft wings also encounter a drag force parallel to the flow direction. The
            formation of a lift force only occurs between a solid and a fluid.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section1_1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>Airplanes generate lift by utilizing thrust to propel forward; this forces gas in the atmosphere to come into direct contact with the solid wings. The lift force overpowers the effects of gravity and causes the plane to fly upwards. Additionally,
            drag acts against the thrust of the airplane leading to a less efficient flight depending on the aerodynamic properties of the airplane design.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section1_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>The lift equation defines the coefficient of lift which is the amount of lift a shape will experience depending on the design of a particular airfoil. The airfoils on aircraft work by causing air to flow faster over the wing in comparison to
            the airflow under the wing. This causes the air pressure above the wing to be lower, thus creating lift. The equation below translates to the product of the coefficient, density multiplied by velocity squared divided by two, and the area of
            the airfoil. The coefficient is often found experimentally through real world measurements of the airfoil.</p>

            <h2>Aerodynamic Concepts</h2>
          </header>
          <p>One of the most important aspects of aerodynamics for an airplane to maintain is lift. Without a constant force of lift, the weight of the plane (a force caused my gravity’s downward acceleration, with Weight = Airplane Mass * 9.8) would bring
            the vehicle to the ground. To maintain lift, the pressure above the wings must be significantly lower than the pressure below the wing. This can be achieved by means of an airfoil, which is built into the design of the wings. Below is the
            cross section of a plane wing, which contains the airfoil design:</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section2_1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>The curved upper part of the wing increases the velocity of the air that flows over the top. This is able to create lift because of Bernoulli’s Principle, which states that increased velocity of a flowing substance, in this case air, means decreased
            pressure. This can be expressed mathematically in Bernoulli’s Equation below:</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section2_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>Where p = pressure<br>ρ (Greek letter rho) = density<br>V = velocity<br>g = acceleration due to gravity<br>h = elevation<br>With n as a constant<br>From this equation, we can conclude that velocity and pressure are inversely proportional because
            they are on the same side of the equation. The inverse relationship can be shown by rearranging the equation:</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section2_3.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>If we leave ρ (ro), g, h, and n constant and increase V, then p must decrease to balance the equation. This demonstrates how higher velocity of airflow on the top of the wing would decrease the pressure and create the pressure difference necessary
            to maintain lift throughout the airplane’s flight.</p>

            <h2>What is Drag?</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Drag Force depends on the density of air, the velocity of the object, the air’s viscosity and compressibility, the object’s size and shape, and the object’s inclination to flow.</p>
          <p>The Equation to calculate the force of drag is:</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section3_1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <p>ρ (Greek letter rho) = mass density of the fluid</p>
          <p>V = flow velocity relative to the object</p>
          <p>A = some reference area</p>
          <p>C<sub>d</sub> = the drag coefficient*</p>
          <p>Drag is an aerodynamic force that opposes the motion of an object as it moves with constant contact to a fluid such as a liquid or gas. In this case, the fluid we will refer to is air. As mentioned before, while lift acts perpendicularly to the motion of an object, drag acts in the same dimension as the object’s motion but in the opposite direction. In order for drag to act as a resistive force, there has to be a difference in velocity between the object in motion and the fluid. Thus, if there is no motion, there is no drag force.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section3_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>Drag can be thought of as air friction and one of the reasons drag exists is because of skin friction between the gas molecules of the air and the surface of the object in motion. So, the smoother a surface, the smaller the magnitude of skin friction.</p>
          <p>Another source of drag is form drag which is dependent on the – you guessed it– form or shape of the object in motion. Due to the uneven shape of objects in motion such as cars or planes, the velocity and pressure of air change at different points. Pressure is important to note as pressure is the momentum of gas and any change in that momentum produces a force on the body. According to Newton’s second law, any external force causes a change in motion to an object. It is this force which is the essence of drag as it resists the motion.</p>
          <p>Drag is also caused by induced drag or “drag due to lift.” The magnitude of induced drag depends on the amount and distribution of lift which is mostly dependent on the size/span and shape of the wing. Thus, careful consideration into wing designs is necessary to optimize flight conditions.</p>
          <p>Lastly, there’s wave drag and ram drag. Wave drag occurs when the object in motion approaches the speed of sound. A resulting shockwave leads to a total loss in pressure. We can find the magnitude of wave drag through the Mach units of air flow.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section3_3.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>*to find the C<sub>d</sub> is complex as it takes into account most of the mentioned sources of drag.</p>

            <h2>What is Thrust?</h2>
          </header>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section4_1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <p>T = Thrust</p>
          <p>V = velocity</p>
          <p>dm = change in mass</p>
          <p>dt = change in time</p>
          <p>In order for aircrafts, rockets, or any object, for that matter, to take off or move, thrust is an important force that allows for this to happen. If we recall that in Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion, F= ma, Thrust is an external force that causes a change in velocity. When looking at a free-body diagram of an object at rest, we can see that the forces acting on it are gravity in the downward to direction which is countered by a normal force of the ground in an upward direction. It is at rest as the vertical forces cancel out and there are no forces in the horizontal direction. Let’s say we want to send a rocket upward: we want to provide a force that can change the velocity from rest. In order to do that, a force, in this case, thrust from a propulsion system, can provide an imbalance that overcomes the force of gravity.</p>

          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section4_3.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <h4>Rocket FBD at Lift-off</h4>
          <p>Thrust works when there is a propulsion system in contact with a working fluid. An energy source, heat, is required to do work to accelerate a mass of gas. This heat is most commonly produced by the combustion of a fuel. This mass of gas then accelerates against an engine . The engine does work (W = Fd) against the acceleration of gas thereby creating thrust. Thrust is a vector quantity so it has direction. Thrust works in the opposite direction to the acceleration of gas.</p>
          <p>As mentioned before, the heat energy required to accelerate gas is created by the combustion of fuel. This implies a change in mass for the aircraft as fuel is being burned and converted into energy. In the equation for thrust, mentioned above, we account for this change in mass with the variable dm.</p>

            <h2>Different Airfoil Designs</h2>
          </header>
          <p>The design of different airfoils all affect the speed, drag, and stability for an aircraft. The manufacturer will take into consideration their clients goals for efficiency and quality of flight in order to develop the perfect airfoil shape.</p>
          <p>The two predominant types of airfoils are laminar flow and conventional shapes. A laminar flow wing's thickest section occurs at about fifty percent of the wing’s chord. The thinner design of laminar flow wings allows it to achieve a higher
            speed than conventional wings; therefore, it is more fuel efficient.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section5_1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>In contrast, a conventional wing’s thickest section occurs at about the twenty-five percent section of the wing’s chord towards the leading edge. The thicker design of conventional wings lead to a more stable flight and mitigates stalling in
            the air.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section5_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>The following diagram discusses the general characteristics of different conventional airfoil designs.</p>

            <h2>How have Airplanes Evolved?</h2>
          </header>
          <p>The first airplane was invented by the Wright Brothers in 1903. This first plane was a biplane with a gas-powered propulsion engine that ran its propellers. The structure of the plane does not implement an airfoil with a camber or a single wing.
            Instead, its airfoil was crafted through trial and error in a wind tunnel the brothers designed.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section6_1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>As World War I began, planes became useful to military forces around the world. These battle planes were light but still maintained the original biplane structure with camber-less airfoils and a gas-powered propeller. While they had much greater
            aerodynamics than the original Wright plane and could remain in the air much longer, they still did not take full advantage of the potential of Bernoulli’s Principle to sustain lift.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section6_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>Airplanes also served an important role in WWII. However, major developments in plane design were made as air travel as a commercial business became popular. These newer planes, no longer geared for war, focused on carrying capacity and increased
            aerodynamics. They implemented an airfoil with a cambar, greatly increasing velocity of airflow and decreasing the pressure on top of the wing to increase lift. Unlike the modern airliners that would soon follow, many of these planes still
            used propellers instead of jet propulsion.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section6_3.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>Modern planes now combine a sleek, cambered wing design and the power of jet propulsion to produce a strong thrust. Military planes optimize speed and maneuverability over capacity, which lends to their sleek shape and their unique airfoil design.</p>

            <h2>The Future of Airplanes</h2>
          </header>
          <p>As we look to the future, it is important that we seek our interests in an environmentally conscious and efficient manner. Our world is getting closer and more connected. Travel is becoming more common for business, service, vacations, and national defense. With the need for more green yet efficient travel, aerospace engineers are looking for cleaner sources of fuel and even new and improved designs for aircrafts. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>
          <h4>New Designs</h4>
          <p>In 2017 Airbus’s A340 laminar-flow “BLADE” made its first successful flight. “BLADE” is an EU-sponsored initiative to make aviation a cleaner mode for transportation by reducing aircraft emissions. The A340 promises up to “a 50% reduction of wing friction and up to five percent lower CO2 emission” and it is the “first test aircraft in the world combining a transonic laminar wing profile with a standard aircraft internal primary structure” (Airbus). As mentioned in previous sections, the size and shape of wings contribute to drag induced by lift. Airbus took into account the concepts of lift and drag to design the new wing profile, thereby optimizing the aircraft’s streamlined-flight properties. A positive externality of this new design is the reduced emissions.</p>
          <h4>Cleaner Fuel Sources</h4>
          <p>When designing aircrafts or rockets, it is important to account for the change in mass as fuel is converted to energy. However, the use of carbon-based fuels has taken a toll on the environment. As a result, companies in all sectors and industries are seeking cleaner and more efficient processes, products, and services. In the Aviation industry, the design of aircrafts have to change in order to provide all-electric or hybrid models of aircrafts. Airbus currently has the ZEROe initiative which seeks to “develop the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft by 2035” (Airbus). With hybrid-hydrogen models, the mass of fuels is lighter as hydrogen is significantly lighter than carbon based fuels. Because hydrogen is lighter, it also doesn’t linger in the atmosphere, thus making it a cleaner fuel source. Of course with such a switch, factors such as thrust, lift, and drag must be accounted for in the designing of aircrafts.</p>
