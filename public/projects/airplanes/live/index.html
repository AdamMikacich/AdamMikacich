            <h2>What is Lift?</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Lift, a perpendicular force to the direction of flow, enables airplanes to achieve flight through an aerodynamic design. In addition to experiencing a lift force, aircraft wings also encounter a drag force parallel to the flow direction. The
            formation of a lift force only occurs between a solid and a fluid.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section1_1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>Airplanes generate lift by utilizing thrust to propel forward; this forces gas in the atmosphere to come into direct contact with the solid wings. The lift force overpowers the effects of gravity and causes the plane to fly upwards. Additionally,
            drag acts against the thrust of the airplane leading to a less efficient flight depending on the aerodynamic properties of the airplane design.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section1_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>The lift equation defines the coefficient of lift which is the amount of lift a shape will experience depending on the design of a particular airfoil. The airfoils on aircraft work by causing air to flow faster over the wing in comparison to
            the airflow under the wing. This causes the air pressure above the wing to be lower, thus creating lift. The equation below translates to the product of the coefficient, density multiplied by velocity squared divided by two, and the area of
            the airfoil. The coefficient is often found experimentally through real world measurements of the airfoil.</p>

            <h2>Aerodynamic Concepts</h2>
          </header>
          <p>One of the most important aspects of aerodynamics for an airplane to maintain is lift. Without a constant force of lift, the weight of the plane (a force caused my gravity’s downward acceleration, with Weight = Airplane Mass * 9.8) would bring
            the vehicle to the ground. To maintain lift, the pressure above the wings must be significantly lower than the pressure below the wing. This can be achieved by means of an airfoil, which is built into the design of the wings. Below is the
            cross section of a plane wing, which contains the airfoil design:</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section2_1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>The curved upper part of the wing increases the velocity of the air that flows over the top. This is able to create lift because of Bernoulli’s Principle, which states that increased velocity of a flowing substance, in this case air, means decreased
            pressure. This can be expressed mathematically in Bernoulli’s Equation below:</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section2_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>Where p = pressure<br>ρ (Greek letter rho) = density<br>V = velocity<br>g = acceleration due to gravity<br>h = elevation<br>With n as a constant<br>From this equation, we can conclude that velocity and pressure are inversely proportional because
            they are on the same side of the equation. The inverse relationship can be shown by rearranging the equation:</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section2_3.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>If we leave ρ (ro), g, h, and n constant and increase V, then p must decrease to balance the equation. This demonstrates how higher velocity of airflow on the top of the wing would decrease the pressure and create the pressure difference necessary
            to maintain lift throughout the airplane’s flight.</p>

            <h2>Different Airfoil Designs</h2>
          </header>
          <p>The design of different airfoils all affect the speed, drag, and stability for an aircraft. The manufacturer will take into consideration their clients goals for efficiency and quality of flight in order to develop the perfect airfoil shape.</p>
          <p>The two predominant types of airfoils are laminar flow and conventional shapes. A laminar flow wing's thickest section occurs at about fifty percent of the wing’s chord. The thinner design of laminar flow wings allows it to achieve a higher
            speed than conventional wings; therefore, it is more fuel efficient.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section3_1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>In contrast, a conventional wing’s thickest section occurs at about the twenty-five percent section of the wing’s chord towards the leading edge. The thicker design of conventional wings lead to a more stable flight and mitigates stalling in
            the air.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section3_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>The following diagram discusses the general characteristics of different conventional airfoil designs.</p>

            <h2>How have Airplanes Evolved?</h2>
          </header>
          <p>The first airplane was invented by the Wright Brothers in 1903. This first plane was a biplane with a gas-powered propulsion engine that ran its propellers. The structure of the plane does not implement an airfoil with a camber or a single wing.
            Instead, its airfoil was crafted through trial and error in a wind tunnel the brothers designed.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section4_1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>As World War I began, planes became useful to military forces around the world. These battle planes were light but still maintained the original biplane structure with camber-less airfoils and a gas-powered propeller. While they had much greater
            aerodynamics than the original Wright plane and could remain in the air much longer, they still did not take full advantage of the potential of Bernoulli’s Principle to sustain lift.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section4_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>Airplanes also served an important role in WWII. However, major developments in plane design were made as air travel as a commercial business became popular. These newer planes, no longer geared for war, focused on carrying capacity and increased
            aerodynamics. They implemented an airfoil with a cambar, greatly increasing velocity of airflow and decreasing the pressure on top of the wing to increase lift. Unlike the modern airliners that would soon follow, many of these planes still
            used propellers instead of jet propulsion.</p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="images/section4_3.jpg" alt="" /></div>
          <p>Modern planes now combine a sleek, cambered wing design and the power of jet propulsion to produce a strong thrust. Military planes optimize speed and maneuverability over capacity, which lends to their sleek shape and their unique airfoil design.</p>
